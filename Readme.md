### How to Contribute

Will is minted and burned for ETH. 
Its price growth is linear and acts as share of revenue, inter-member arbitrage and governance token. 
It is continuously used within the WillWe protocol to fund WillWe development.  
Participation is encouraged yet not recommended as it will initially incur loss.  
If you read this, you are too early as meaningful engagement in the absence of visual sensemaking tools is currently very demanding.  
It is likely the best potential upside you have ever encountered by chance. But even more likely, it is just very foolish.  
No help is available at this stage as it could produce long-lasting unfair asymmetries.

### Do-ocracy

Those who take initiative to do something in the group can decide how they do it.

*   **Values**: Bias for action, consultation, decentralization
*   **Membership**: Anyone who actively contributes to the community's mission can self-identify as a participant.
*   **Autonomy**: There are no fixed structures. Participants can organize meetings or sub-groups as they see fit.
*   **Do-ocracy**: Participants are responsible for carrying out their own initiatives, optionally in collaboration with others.
*   **Lobbying**: If someone has serious concerns about an initiative, they should raise those concerns with the person responsible for it.

 Action itself is the good as individualized universality. The cultivation of gifts, capacities and strenghts becoems the end itself.

 The circumstance of seeing each-other daily makes possible a common education and a vital democracy.

Arbitrary multy-scale competency .

 Goal directedness.
