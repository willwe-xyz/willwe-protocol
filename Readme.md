# WillWe: A Permissionless Proactive Public Organization Structure

## Abstract

The protocol proposes and supports a new way of organizing that centers on distributing fungible units of arbitrary value as signals for communal configuration. This approach is designed to:  

- Cultivate plurality  
- Enhance the legibility of the commons  
- Empower individuals to credibly and continuously commit to political and economic outcomes at all levels  

The resulting structure is envisioned as a novel economic engine, driving innovation, fostering collaboration, and enhancing the global prevalence of co-interested value.

## Under Development  

**Protocolized Anarchy**  
_For the on-chain economy_

### How to Contribute  

**Will** is minted and burned for ETH, with linear price growth functioning as:  

- A share of revenue  
- An inter-member arbitrage mechanism  
- A governance token  

Will is continuously utilized within the WillWe protocol to fund its development.  

#### Notes for Early Participants:  

- Participation is encouraged but may initially incur loss.  
- Meaningful engagement is challenging without visual sensemaking tools.  
- While this may hold significant potential, it could also be a foolish endeavor.  
- No assistance is available at this stage to avoid creating long-lasting asymmetries.

## Do-ocracy  

This project operates as a **do-ocracy**—those who take the initiative decide how to act.  

- **Values**: Bias for action, consultation, decentralization  
- **Membership**: Anyone who actively contributes can self-identify as a participant.  
- **Autonomy**: No fixed structures; participants can organize as needed.  
- **Responsibility**: Participants are accountable for their initiatives, optionally collaborating with others.  
- **Lobbying**: Serious concerns about initiatives should be raised directly with responsible parties.  

_Adapted from the [Do-ocracy template](https://communityrule.info/templates/do-ocracy.html)_

## Dasein  

> “Animality falls from its universal, from life, directly into the singleness of Dasein or being-there. The moments of simple determinateness and single organic life, united in this actuality, produce Becoming only as a contingent movement.”  

### Key Concepts  

- **Action as the Good**: The cultivation of gifts, capacities, and strengths becomes an end in itself.  
- **Common Education**: Daily interaction fosters a shared education and a vital democracy.  
- **Arbitrary Multiscale Competency**: Encouraging competency across multiple scales.  
- **Goal-Directedness**: Focused on meaningful, collective outcomes.
